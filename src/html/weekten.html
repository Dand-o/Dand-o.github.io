    <h2>IL Learning</h2>
    <h3>Recording my evaluation and reflecting on own practice.</h3>
    <p>I chose the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zwfm8hv"> BBC Bitesize</a> website to check on these tools, mostly because they
    have a similar interactive element to the one I would like to implement. Surprisingly some of the tests were a fail on this. I wasn't 
  surprised that the obvious pieces of text were fine, like the black text on a white background. But there were some elements, where the hyperlink was a purple colour on a 
grey background and I was surprised to see that this was a fail for link contrast. After some reflection, this has made me realise that although I find something easy to read, 
this doesn't mean everyone will find it easy to read, and I've recently changed the colour pallette that I want to use, and now I'm concerned about the accessible nature of
colours I have picked! I have always had accessibility in mind, but I have been surprised by my findings on the BBC bitesize website. One thing that I liked was the 
readability tool. It showed that the Bitesize website had a readability for 10 to 11 year olds, which I believe is what their target audience is as it's for younger
school aged children to learn and study </p>

<h2>Lab work</h2>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>Task one was to learn a little about subtitles and captioning your videos for online consumption. They are both very helpful and powerful tools, and are now
  very much considered a must have on every video available online. </p>
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>Task two was to create .vtt files and incorporate them into my edited video to help describe the videos for accessibility.
  You can see the working captions/transcript in <a href="/src/html/weeknine.html">week nine</a>. Make sure to toggle on the subtitles to see them in action.</p>
