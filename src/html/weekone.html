      <h3>Task 1 - List of topics</h3>
      <p>

        <h4>Sub-topics:</h4><br />
        <p>- ECCO<br />
        		○ Data, information -  knowledge and Wisdom (DIKW) <br>
		        ○ Concepts and Theories <br>
		        ○ Web 2.0 - Expertise (anyone and everyone)<br>
       <p> - DMIS 1A<br />
        		○ Information literacy for a networked world <br> 
		        ○ Information in context <br>
		        ○ A world of data and information<br>

        - the recent downfall of the information quality on Twitter/X.<br />
        - Community notes Bots "Have you read this article" before
        retweeting.<br />
        - Re-use of old news stories to provoke reactions<br />


        <h3>Task 2 - narrowing down, asking questions and finding sources.</h3>
        
        <p>	<b>What questions do I want my website to answer?</b><br>
    - What is misinformation?<br>
	- How can we identify it?<br> 
	- What are examples of misinformation?<br> 
	- The rise in misinformation.<br> 
  <p>In the last few years we have had a lot of world events unfolding infront of our eyes, all through the use of social media.
  We are in a time where we can log into Twitter/X and get real time information from people on the ground, faster than ever before.
  Much of the research over the last few years (2020-2023) will cover events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  Using the literature from these events, we can hopefully itentify trends in how misinformation spreads on social media, and provide an insight on
  how we can combat it, using skills and knowledge on what to look for whenever we face a global event that is being broadcast online.

  <p> It is important to use advanced searches when using the University of Glasgow's online library search to narrow down my results to academic sources and reputable websites.<br></p>

    <p>	2. Useful to use the keywords from academic papers that I have found in my initial search, this is where I was able to narrow down the search much further 
      when I found a relevant paper. <br>
	
	3. "Misinformation" seems to have best results for academic papers when using the boolean operator "AND" with: 
  social media, social media apps, online, user generated content, UGC. <br>
	
	"fake-news" is a less favoured search term as it often points to articles and news stories regarding specific 
  incidents or stories relating to Donald Trump and other extremes. <br>
	4. Data visualisation:<a href="https://answerthepublic.com/mm2f4g/reports/6a296476-618d-43b4-b1aa-c7cf04d1f481/edit?recently_searched=true">Answer the Public</a><br>

  <!---Image size is horribly large, but the writing on the image is too small for smaller size-->
	
 <P>Notice a mention of "fake-news" in this as a related search? - seems like this may be something I may have to address in the website as this is a common search term, and 
  is linked to a lot of negative connotations such as Trump and conspiricies.<br>
<p>"Who spreads misinformation on social media" is an interesting search, and in research there is evidence to show that it is in fact 
the user that has a responsibility to prevent and stop the spread (Khan and Idris, 2019).  </p>

      <p>
        I think this is an important topic to cover, especially with the massive
        changes on Twitter/X. With Twitter previously being a massive source of
        real-time information on unfolding news stories, the policies in place
        previously gave users a feeling that the information they were consuming
        on the website could be trusted to a degree, with less risk of
        misinformation from bots and more policies in place to ensure the spread
        of misinformation was reduced.<br> Although some of these tools are still in
        place (community notes) there is reason to be concerned about the rise
        in information on the social media platform. In light of recent breaking
        stories on the platform, we can analyse and compare how the changes have
        affected the quality of information being spread. <p><br>
        <h3>Audience:</h3>  
        <p>People who use Twitter/X or online apps and the internet in general as a source for real-time information may be interested in
        this topic, but also, those who may be less literate in information
        online. I want my audience to be of the younger generation, and those who are guardians of younger folk, 
        so they can navigate and use the resource as well, to help them understand the importance of information literacy online and pass
        on the knowledge to their children or children they take care of, be it teachers, lecturers or parents.
        I want to create a project that educates and challenges people
        on their bias and ensure people are thinking about which sources they
        consume and engage their thinking before taking the information they
        seek online as fact initially. <p>By presenting this through a multimedia
        format, I feel like I can engage an audience to participate in making
        choices and informing the user why their choice was correct/incorrect.
        For example: Allowing a user to select between two images of the same
        news story, one is misinformation, one is legit. By selecting the image
        they feel is correct, we can educate on why their decision was right or
        wrong, and explain in detail what they should look for if need be. What
        is misinformation? - How can we identify it? - What are examples of
        misinformation? - The rise in misinformation.<br>
        <p>One of the ideas I have had, especially given my target audience is of the younger generations, 
          between 12-18 years old, is the use of an interactive element that mimics the experience of TikTok. 
          And infinite scroll type of idea in which a narrative is presented to them, as they use their scroll wheel to find out more, 
          usuing attractive visuals, sounds and images to entice the user to want to see what comes next, whilst also educating them on the topic.
