<h1>Week<br>Three.</h1>
    <h2>Week 3 Lab IL Learning</h2>
    <h3>Selected reading: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/storytelling-elements-31b2a6a7e373">Elements of Good Story Telling</a></a> </h3>
      <h4>Summary of reading</h4>
      <p> This article on Medium dicusses the importance of story-telling, and how it can play a vital part in growth and development. 
        Story telling is an art, and by understanding and improving this art, we can captivate our audiences and keep them engaged. Because my audience will be 
        primarily younger people, I believe it is important to ensure the content of my website is engaging and interesting, and not just a wall of text, which helps 
        keep the yougner generations attention on the topic at hand. </p>
        <h4>Thoughts and Planning</h4>
<p>After further research into my topic and the reading provided, I have realised largest part of my audience is going to be younger people. 
The resource I want to create should be aimed at younger people fromaround 12-18 years old, but also provide a good source of information and used as a resource
for adults who wish to access the information to help their children, or children they teach. Although this is still a broader audience that narrowing it down to just children, 
I felt it was important to include adults as they are the ones who will be able to provide the resources to children and help them access the information.<br>
Keeping this in mind, Ihave chosen to go down a more "cartoony" look with the visuals I will add to the website. This includes a more vibrant and "fun" colour pallet. 
Understnading my topic is an important part of being able to create a good  resource, and also evolve this into a story that provides valuable information to the user, whilst 
providing a fun and engaging experience. <br> 
Firstly, I need to establish the follwing elements:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Plot</li>
  <li>Character</li>
  <li>Theme</li>
  <li>Dialogue</li>
  <li>Melody</li>
  <li>Decor</li>
  <li>Spectacle</li>
