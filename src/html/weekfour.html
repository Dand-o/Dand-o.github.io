    <h1>Week <br>four.</h1>
    <h2>Week Four IL Activity.</h2>
    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>I want my website to be as "clean" and pleasent to use as possible. The colour scheme I have initially went for
      is a pallette I picked from the <a href="https://coolors.co/user/palettes/652c2147215545000b49f2f6">Coolers</a> website.<br>
      I felt the pallete was pleasent to look at, but after further research into to colour tones and the effect colour can have on 
      projects, I feel like this colour scheme is too causal and more like a "blog" than an informative website. 
      It doesn't evoke a sense of professionalism in the way I want it too. The websites colour pallete will most certainly 
      change over time.

      <h3>Orginal Pallette</h3>
      <h3><img id="image4" src="/assets/images/original_pallette.png" width="800" height="250"></h3>
      <h3>Updated Pallette</h3>
      <h3><img id="image5" src="/assets/images/new-colour-palette.png" width="800" height="250"></h3>
      <h4>Why the new pallete?</h4>
      <p>After finding more resources that are similar to my project topic, and identifying my target audience being 13-18 years old, I found that a brighter more "fun" pallete would
        suit the website more, providing eye catching visual and feeling a lot less "serious", albeit the topic is serious, this can often put users off engaging with the content.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h2>Lab Work</h2>
    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>Task one required me to create my .css folder name it logically. I called it "mycss.css" and I linked my stylesheet in my HTML documents that is able to be viewed in my 
      code via the GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <p>Task two required me to apply my CSS skills to the website and develop my style sheet. The result: what you see on this page!<br>
    I will develop much of the CSS as I progress in this project, as I mentioned before I feel like the original colour 
  pallette doesn't suit my topic of choice, and needs to feel more professional and clean. <br>
One of the important aspects of the CSS styling was to ensure each page has a consistent style across the board. 
This ensures that the user experience is fluid across the website and easy to navigate. The font I have picked is clear and
easy to read in both the headers and paragraphs and by sticking to a dark font on a light background esures further readability.</p>
