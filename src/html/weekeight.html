    <h1>Week<br> eight.</h1>
    <h2>IL Learning</h2>
    <h3>Task one</h3>
    <p>I had a look at <a href="https://devotionexperience.dolcegabbana.com/en/piazzetta">Dolce & Gabbana's </a> "Digital experience" website, in which they wanted to create an
      immersive experience for their customers to promote a perfume. I initially though this would be a great example of the use of sound and audio on a website, 
      especially to create emotions and ambiance, but I was left somewhat dissapointed by the lack of audio! You navigate your way through an italian town next to the sea, 
      and I was hoping to hear the rush of waves and bird song, but, it was not until I reached the 'Piazzetta' that you are greeted by a man, who speaks to you. This was the only 
      audio ques, even when clicking on interactives there was no satifying 'ping' or ambient audio. With the hard work that has went in to the visuals, it is noticably let down 
      by the lack of audio and sound. This is a good example of why audio can be a very important aspect of a multimedia project. To evoke the sense of 'being' somewhere, or 'feeling' 
      something. <br>

      <p>A visually beautiful website, but substantially let down by the lack of audio.</p> 
   </p>
    <h3>Task two</h3>
    <p>For task two I was asked to acquire audio for my project, I have found two audio files from a copyright free audio and sounds and I have uploaded these to my 
      masterfiles folder in my OneDrive.
    </p>
    <h2> Lab Work</h2>
    <h3>Task one</h3>
    <p>I have selected two sounds/audio files to use for this project. One being an ambient radio sound of a news reporter 
      talking about Covid-19, something which was, and still is very much a topic that is often shrouded in misinformation.
      You can listen to this Audio below, in the different format options.<br>
<h3>Master file</h3>

      </audio> 

    </p>
    <h3>Task two</h3>
    <p>As somebody who wouldn't call themself an audiophile, I honestly struggle to see much difference in the lower quality audio files that I have 
      edited. Although, I understand the importance of good audio quality when you are trying to create an immersive experience for the user. I have to 
      keep in mind the files size for the loading time of any audio files I include in the project. So long as the audio is clear and understandable, and 
      loads nicely into the webpage for good optimisation, I will be happy to incluse the smallest file size possible without audibly hearing the difference. <br>
      <p>Below is the other audio file I have incorporated into my project, this is a notification sound, which I may use as a navigation sound.
