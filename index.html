    <h1>Misinformation<br> on Social Media.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <p>My project will aim to educate and challenge the audiences views on misinformation on social media.
      By using digital media, I want to create an interactive and educational experience that allows the audience to
      think about the choices they make when consuming information online. By creating an experience that educates
      people on the important decisions they make online, I hope to create awarenes on the importance of information literacy.

      Using a simple interface, which requires the user to simply scroll through the website to go through the information,
      the website will occasionally provide a simple selection between two 'news stories', requiring the audience to choose
      which one they would look at online, and by selecting, we can provide reasons why the selection they made was good or bad.
    </p>
    <h3> Why is this topic important?</h3>
    <p>With the recent covid-19 pandemic, misinformation has gained considerable traction  through the medium of social media with the popularity of user 
      generated content and easier access to the internet. With the option to share posts and articles from websites without the need to verify sources, 
      or check for validity users are often unknowingly sharing false information or misleading information online (Sallam et al., 2020). Solutions to combatting  
      misinformation on social media has been sporadic at best, the discussions often lead to whether the user is responsible for the spread of misinformation, 
      or if the onus is on the platforms in which the content is shared. Misinformation shapes  public opinion and can influence key aspects of society, such as 
      convincing people to avoid vaccinations, or conduct unsafe behaviour online, such as consuming large amounts of over the counter drugs (Ritschel, 2023) or 
      romanticising harmful behaviour (Patrick, 2023). By creating a useful resource on identifying misinformation  
      for younger people to learn and use their critical thinking skills, I can encourage them to take a step back and think before they share. </p>
