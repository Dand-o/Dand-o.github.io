<h1>Week <br>Two.</h1>
<h2>Week two IL Learning</h2>
<h3> Task 1</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of an audience for this particular type of research and topic,
        firstly, it would be important to find literature that provides insight
        into the information literacy of online users of social media platforms.
        We will be focusing mostly on Twitter/X.</p><br>
        
      <p>Twitter was once a (mostly) reliable source of real time news and information, with many
        ways to verify sources of the information we found on the website.
        However, there have been recent changes to the platform, many of which
        make it more difficult to identify the real news or accurate information
        we consume on the platform.</p><br>

      <p>
        The main audience we want to target would be casual users of the social
        media platform, those who seek out breaking news and stories on there.
        Many of the recent changes have changed the landscape of the platform,
        making what was once an easily identifiable good source of information,
        now much easier to spot. The casual user may not be aware of the
        potential inaccuracy of information, taking what they see from "blue
        tick" accounts as factual, as previously a blue tick meant an account
        was verified by Twitter as being a person of importance or relevance
        within the media or other organisations. Now, anyone can pay for this
        "verification" and in doing so, we have seen a rise in bot accounts
        powered by AI algorithms that often tweet current trending topics with
        incorrect sources or media.</p><br>
        <p>Creating a project that can educate on the
        warning signs of inaccurate information, challenging their perspectives
        on what is "real" and what is "fake" news and providing facts about the
        importance of information literacy in the age of social media, we can
        hopefully prevent people falling for misinformation and being cautious
        about the information they consume. By providing an information source,
        which educates and challenges current views, it will hopefully spread
        the knowledge of spotting the warning signs and prevent such a
        widespread problem of people spreading bad information throughout the
        internet.</p>

    <!---Table contents for audience identification-->
      <p>The following table is an audience profile table, this helps me organise and my thoughts on a target audience that I want to 
        target my website towards. The will change and be updated over time as I uncover further evidence and research as the project 
    goes on. </p>

<!---Task 3 content-->
<h3>Task 3</h3>
<p>Much of the research I have found so far in academic papers often focuses on users 18+.<br>
    <b><p>User Story:<br></b>
<p>1. "As a student at university, I want to be able to disseminate the information I consume online and ensure I can identify false information at a glance."</p> 
<p>2. "As a middle-aged high school teacher, I want to be able to confidently analyse news sources, and share the knowledge of how to identify misinformation to my students"</p>
<h2> Lab Activity</h2>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>
        Does the website
        <a href="(https://pudding.cool/2023/09/invisible-epidemic/)"
          >Invisible Epidemic</a>":<b><br />• effectively addresses a topic?</b><br> - Yes. It provokes an
        emotional feeling as well through the use of the animations and graphics
        it uses. As the user scrolls, and watches the graphics change with the
        context of what it represents scrolling, it creates a sense of
        connection to the anonymous stats that the author is presenting you.
        It's a story, but it is providing you with hard truths on the impact and
        epidemic of "loneliness"<br><b>• Offer opportunities for social change, new learning and/or
          experiences?</br></b>
        >
        - Yes, it enlightened me to the seriousness of loneliness. How it
        affects our health and well-being. It also made me think about other
        people in my life and how they may be feeling and enacted a change in my
        way of thinking about how important it is to be around others and to
        ensure the people around me are okay. <br><b>• have any specific features that
        you would like to explore as an effective way of presenting a topic,
        such as:</b><br> - The pixelated graphics representing the anonymous data,
        making you feel "connected" to the person <br>- The sense of "looking in" on
        people<br> - The interactive storytelling by allowing the user to scroll and
        take in the information at their own pace<br> - The impactful presentation
        of the data, the colours, the personalisation in the story telling.<br> -
        The user interaction was amazing. Simple, easy and allowed for a
        experience I could take part in on my own terms. 
        
        <p> Does the website <a href="(//www.art.yale.edu)" >Yale art School</a> <br> <b>• effectively addresses a topic?</b><br> - It does
        explain the reasons for the website, but it doesn't do so effectively.
        The box with the information and background is in much smaller writing
        than a poster they have on the website for an exhibition, which your
        eyes are immediately drawn to.<br> <b>• Offer opportunities for social change,
        new learning and/or experiences?<br></b> - No, the website is supposed to be a
        collaborative wiki for the School of art community, but if anything it
        is showing that the students don't use their (assumed) artistic skills
        as a collaborative team to create a easy to use, artistic and
        informative website. The website is somewhat offensive in its design.
        Bright colours, text at various different sizes and typography, I don't
        know where to look because too many things are grabbing my attention.
        It's inaccessible as well. Most certainly is not an inclusive website.<br> <b>•
        have any specific features that you would like to explore as an
        effective way of presenting a topic, such as:</b> <br>Absolutely not.</p>
