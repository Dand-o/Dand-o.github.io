    <h1>Week <br>five.</h1>
    <h2>Week Five IL Activity.</h2>
    <h3>Task 2 *COMPLETE TASK ONE* </h3>
    <p> <div id="saferinternet"> </div> <a href=https://saferinternet.org.uk/online-issue/misinformation> Chosen Website - Safer Internet</a> 

     <p><ul> <li>Accuracy: This website aims to educate and give advice on how to stay safer on the internet, there are various different sections related to different online issues. In this case, I want to focus on misinformation. They have a section regarding this topic, and the information on there is clear and concise. The writing itself is less about the facts of the issue, and more centred around how to help and what to do about misinformation. They link to other resources that are reliable and point to many helpful </li>
      
      <li>Active voice: The active voice is used correctly and it's not used excessively at all. The writing seems very appropriate to the topic and, although much more conversation in points, it still reads like a reliable source of help and advice, with no jargon and useful explanations where needed. </li>
      
      <li>From the misinformation section, the language seems to be free of bias, making no assumptions about younger people, or their parents. They guide the reader in a way that doesn't assume a persons skill or experience online due to their age, and gives clear explanations of ways in which things can be addressed in a broad and reassuring manner. </li>
      
      <li>Clarity: I have slightly touched upon this above, but the language used is clear, concise and free of jargon. Where there are words that have to be used that describe a particular topic that may not be common knowledge, they make  sure to explain or describe the topic in a very accessible way. </li>
      
      <li>Conciseness: The website uses short sentence structure, and they get to the point very quickly. Clear language and clear graphics to spread the information in a pleasant way so the reader doesn't feel overwhelmed with the information on screen. </li>
      
      <li>Conversational: Uses a conversational tone, makes It rather easy to read. Contractions used appropriately, and makes it feel easier to read and much more natural to read as well. </li>
      
      <li>Correctness: Very well proof-read. No mistakes (that I can see) and seems professional and well edited. This is important for this particular kind of website, as this is giving advice and must seem reputable. Personally, if I were to find an obvious spelling mistake or the incorrect use of words, I would doubt the advice that is given.</li>
      
     <li>Parallelism: Because of the nature of the text, there seems to be a lack of parallelism in the language. Theyre not trying to sell something, so there's not a huge need to be 'punchy'. But the one thing I notices is their used of examples are often in two's or three's:<br>
      
        "Discuss who they follow, what types of adverts they see, and what stories they find surprising or suspicious."</li>
        
      <li>Positive Language: The language used is very carefully constructed to be as inclusive and bias free as possible. By doing so, the language itself comes across positive, even when talking about a negative. They use language to provide knowledge and advice on how to help identify misinformation, how to tackle it and what to do to help teach people to identify it. They encourage positivity, and so, naturally create a positive tone in their writing. </li>
      
      <li>Strong nouns and verbs: 
      
      "It can be tempting to share surprising or attention-grabbing online content with your child or your family group chats, but make sure to fact-check these links before you do."
      
      This is a good example of not overdoing the strong nouns and verbs. They use them to accentuate their point, without causing the language to be too overwhelming and confusing. It still emphasises the point, without becoming too distracting.  </li>
      
      <li>Sentence Variety: The variety in this page is very good. Not one single sentence starts with the same words. </li>
      
      <li>Shorter paragraphs: They use a great lengths of sentences and paragraphs. Always keeping things short and concise, simple to ready and getting the point quickly. This is important for somebody who is seeking the information they are providing and ensuring it is easy to find and consume. </li>
      
      <li>Tone and Voice: There is a more informal tone to this website. But it doesn't lack formality either, it is conversational, and uses informality where appropriate, giving a nice conversational feel to the content whilst also keeping a professional tone where needed. </p></ul>
    <h3>Task 3</h3>
    <p>When reflecting on the project so far and considering the 'Assess' step in the process, I feel like I have an understanding of my target audience when it comes to Misinformation on Social Media. Understanding social media is a key part to this project, and social media itself is a global platform and affects people of all ages, genders geographical locations and religious beliefs and so, my project must consider this and ensure it is accessible to a diverse audience. 
      My purpose is to educate and inform on this topic, rather than give advice. I believe it is key to understanding an issue from its foundations. 
      It's important to give advice and to point people in the right direction, but having people truly understand the problem is a key part of ensuring that advice is truly understood and acted upon. 

I do think I need to have a much more in depth knowledge of my audience, understand what it really means to cater to a global audience and ensure I have a lot of key points to this included in my project before moving forward. 
Once I feel confident in this, I will be much more confident in how I approach the topic.</p>
<h2>Lab Work</h2> 
<h3>Task One *TO BE FINISHED* </h3>
 
<img id="image" src="Images/voyant screenshot.png" height="450" width="600"  </img>
<p>As expected, the readability index of this website is quite high. When viewing the website, I did feel a sense that it was easy to digest with bitesize pieces of information and clear and simple language. When we think of Misinformation on Social media, we know that this is an "online" space, and the term "online" is the most frequently used word in this webpage. 
I do find the webpage to have a good variety of sentences and such, although, when you visualise the data, it does show there is a repetition of words such as "online", "media" and "internet". When consuming the content, I didn't feel like this was an issue, or something that stood out to me, mostly because these words are use in the correct context and are used appropriately. 
The average word per sentence is also unsurprising to me, 30 words isn't much, and it is very evident when you read the page that you can get your information quickly and without much searching. It's there and it's quick to read.<br></p>
<img id="image" src="Images/voyant_screenshot_2.png">
  

<p>
  Here we can see the use of "positive" and "negative" language. In this websites case, much of the negative language is linked to a direct discussion of a topic, and not the use of negative language to describe or tell their narrative. Their advice, and own words are mostly positive such as "encourage", "Support" and "safe". 
  They seem to be aware of the impact of these negative words and provide alternative, positive language.</p>
</p>
<h2>Task 2: Create Samples of text </h2><br>

  <h3>Sample 1: Introduction to webstite - Would you share this post? </h3> <br>

  <img id="mininformation" src="Images/Misleading info screenshot - week 5.png"> <br>
  
  <p> We can see this is a post about the Covid-19 vaccine, but what do you feel when you read this?<br>
    Fear? Concern?<br>
    This post is delibrately misleading, and the poster is relying on people not to click onto the link to the research paper!<br>
    Keeping in mind the original post, I want you to imaine what the research paper talks about that they have linked. <br>
    Do you think the research paper is <b> Negative?</b>or <b>positive</b> towards the Covid-19 vaccine? 
    Most people would assume the research paper talks about a large amount of negatve effects happening because of the vaccine, right?<br>
    Well, infact, The research paper is a small study done on <b>four</b> patients, and goes on to empasise the importance of getting vaccinated, despite their findings.
    Click the image below to reveal the abstract of the paper. I have highlighted the important parts to note. <br> </p>

    <img id="image3" src="Images/Misleading info - context week 5.png">

  <p>The post about the vaccine is a deliberae attempt at spreading misinformation, as they rely on others to share on social 
    media without reading into the context of the post.<br>
    Unfortunately this is a very common practice on social meddia. People will read the short version, share,
    or pass on this information verbally to friends and family. <br> 
    How many times have you heard somebody say "I read on Twitter..." followed by a statement. <br> 
    Posts like the one above create a talking point, and are easy to digest. <br> 
    <h3>So, what can we do about it?</h3>
