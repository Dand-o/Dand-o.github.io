<h1>Week<br>Three.</h1>
    <h2>Week 3 Lab IL Learning</h2>
    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <h4>Selected reading: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/storytelling-elements-31b2a6a7e373">Elements of Good Story Telling</a></h4>
      <h4>Summary of reading</h4>
      <p> This article on Medium dicusses the importance of story-telling, and how it can play a vital part in growth and development. 
        Story telling is an art, and by understanding and improving this art, we can captivate our audiences and keep them engaged. Because my audience will be 
        primarily younger people, I believe it is important to ensure the content of my website is engaging and interesting, and not just a wall of text, which helps 
        keep the yougner generations attention on the topic at hand. </p>
        <h4>Thoughts and Planning</h4>
<p>After further research into my topic and the reading provided, I have realised the largest part of my audience is going to be younger people. 
The resource I want to create should be aimed at younger people from around 12-18 years old, but also provide a good source of information and used as a resource
for adults who wish to access the information to help their children, or children they are guardians of. Although this is still a broader audience that narrowing it down to just children, 
I felt it was important to include adults as they are the ones who will be able to provide the resources to children and help them access the information.<br>
Keeping this in mind, Ihave chosen to go down a more "cartoony" look with the visuals I will add to the website. This includes a more vibrant and "fun" colour pallet. 
Understnading my topic is an important part of being able to create a good  resource, and also evolve this into a story that provides valuable information to the user, whilst 
providing a fun and engaging experience. <br> 
Firstly, I need to establish the follwing elements:
<ul>
  <li>Plot</li>
  <li>Character</li>
  <li>Theme</li>
  <li>Dialogue</li>
  <li>Melody</li>
  <li>Decor</li>
  <li>Spectacle</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p> We can make a story out of anything, be it happy, sad, funny or dark, we have the creative minds to make a story out of anything. 
Stories are universal, so regardless of my audience, I know that by creating a narrative, I can grasp their attention and provide an engaging resource.
The language and media that I use will be the primary resource I will implement to envoke my narrative, creating visual stroy-telling and putting the user 
as the main focus of this project, getting them to interact with media and setting them as the main character.
By using the theme of Misinformation online, and creating a dialogue in which the user is the character, we can put them in the centre of the story,
allowing them to make decisions on what information they would share, and giving them feedback on the choices they make. 
This should keep the user engaged, and wanting to know more about why or how their decisions influenced the outcome of the narrative.
I will use simple point and click media, showing versions of news articles with different pieces of information, that the user can 
select and decide if the source is reliable or not. There is a good example of the kind of interactive experience 
I have in mind on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zwfm8hv">BBC Bitesize</a> website.<br>
The purpose of this project is to entertain, inform and educate the user on the topic of misinformation online, and how to identify it.
Being a young person once, I know that walls of text and black and white, boring resources did not keep me engaged with the topic at hand. 
By using a creative output, such as <a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a>. It has also been said, that people now lose concentration after eight seconds. (source: <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">McSpadden, 2015</a>).
Taking this into consideration, I will create bright, vibrant and engaging visuals that are short and punchy,
so ensure the users attention is always fully enaged. <br> 
Using interactives on the website is also a good way for keeping a neurodiverse audience enagaged. As somebody with ADHD, 
I know myself to be much more interested and engaged with interactive media, so, although not a target audience, it is a good way to ensure we are opening up the 
scope of the project to not just younger people, but younger people with different learning styles and needs.

<h3>Task 2: Plan & Reflection</h3>
<h4>Plan:</h4>
<h3><img src="/assets/images/mind_map_misinformation_planning.png" width="800"></h3>
<h4>Reflection:</h4>
<p>One way I like to visualise my ideas is through mind maps and flowcharts. However, writing is the best way for me to get my ideas out first. 
  My audience will be people who use the internet often, and probably come across misinformation on a daily basis. However, they 
  may not be aware on the signs of misinformation, or how to identify it. Using media, I want to try and put them in a state of mind where they 
  feel immersed and to evoke a sense of emotion in them when they use my resource. Using audio and visuals, I want to create a story that pulls the 
  user in and makes them walk away feeling like they have learned something, but are truly impressed by the way it is delivered. 
  This could be in the form of making the interactive experience feel like a game, or a story, or a quiz, which puts the user in the drivers seat.
  I want them to walk away and tell others about my website and point them to it, so it spreads like wildfire. It's about causing a stir, and making
  people want to share it, just like they do with misinformation.

<h2>Lab work</h2>
<p> The lab work for this week was to incorporate all of these discussions and findings into HTML/CSS and create a Github Repository to showcase
  the project and keep it updated. My Github repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/Dand-o/Dand-o.github.io">here</a>.<br>
