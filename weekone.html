	- The rise in misinformation.<br> 
  <p>In the last few years we have had a lot of world events unfolding infront of our eyes, all through the use of social media.
  We are in a time where we can log into Twitter/X and get real time information from people on the ground, faster than ever before.
  Much of the research over the last few years (2020-2023) will cover events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  Using the literature from these events, we can hopefully itentify trends in how misinformation spreads on social media, and provide an insight on
  how we can combat it, using skills and knowledge on what to look for whenever we face a global event that is being broadcast online.

        I think this is an important topic to cover, especially with the massive
        changes on Twitter/X. With Twitter previously being a massive source of
        real-time information on unfolding news stories, the policies in place
        previously gave users a feeling that the information they were consuming
        on the website could be trusted to a degree, with less risk of
        misinformation from bots and more policies in place to ensure the spread
        of misinformation was reduced.<br> Although some of these tools are still in
        place (community notes) there is reason to be concerned about the rise
        in information on the social media platform. In light of recent breaking
        stories on the platform, we can analyse and compare how the changes have
        affected the quality of information being spread. <p><b> Audience:</b><br>People who
        use Twitter/X as a source for real-time information may be interested in
        this topic, but also, those who may be less literate in information
        online. I want my audience to be as broad as possible, from 13+, and to 
        include everyone up to a university level education. 
        I want to create a project that educates and challenges people
        on their bias and ensure people are thinking about which sources they
        consume and engage their thinking before taking the information they
        seek online as fact initially. <p>By presenting this through a multimedia
        format, I feel like I can engage an audience to participate in making
        choices and informing the user why their choice was correct/incorrect.
        For example: Allowing a user to select between two images of the same
        news story, one is misinformation, one is legit. By selecting the image
        they feel is correct, we can educate on why their decision was right or
        wrong, and explain in detail what they should look for if need be. What
        is misinformation? - How can we identify it? - What are examples of
        misinformation? - The rise in misinformation.
