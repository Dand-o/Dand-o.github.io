    <h1>Week <br>five.</h1>
    <h2>Week Five IL Activity.</h2>
    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>Task one for this week was to review the fourteen characteristics that professional writers employ, and then in task two, I will evaluate the quality of written content
      online. After reviewing these characteristics, I created a table of them, and I evaluated a website that was close to my topic in nature, and evaluted 
      the website based on these fourteen characteristics. You can see the table I have created below. </p>
    </p>
    <h3>Task 2 </h3>
    <h4> <div id="saferinternet"> </div> <a href=https://saferinternet.org.uk/online-issue/misinformation> Chosen Website - Safer Internet</a> </h4></h4>

     
      <table id="text-analysis">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Characteristics</th>
                <th>Comments</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <!-- Rows will be inserted here in myjava.cs -->
        </tbody>
    </table>
     
     
      <p> </p>
    <h3>Task 3</h3>
    <p>When reflecting on the project so far and considering the 'Assess' step in the process, I feel like I have an understanding of my target audience when it comes to Misinformation on Social Media. Understanding social media is a key part to this project, and social media itself is a global platform and affects people of all ages, genders geographical locations and religious beliefs and so, my project must consider this and ensure it is accessible to a diverse audience. 
      My purpose is to educate and inform on this topic, rather than give advice. I believe it is key to understanding an issue from its foundations. 
      It's important to give advice and to point people in the right direction, but having people truly understand the problem is a key part of ensuring that advice is truly understood and acted upon. 

I do think I need to have a much more in depth knowledge of my audience, understand what it really means to cater to a global audience and ensure I have a lot of key points to this included in my project before moving forward. 
Once I feel confident in this, I will be much more confident in how I approach the topic.</p>
<h2>Lab Work</h2> 
<h3>Task One </h3>
 
<img id="image" src="Images/voyant screenshot.png" height="450" width="600"></img>
<p>As expected, the readability index of this website is quite high. When viewing the website, I did feel a sense that it was easy to digest with bitesize pieces of information and clear and simple language. When we think of Misinformation on Social media, we know that this is an "online" space, and the term "online" is the most frequently used word in this webpage. 
I do find the webpage to have a good variety of sentences and such, although, when you visualise the data, it does show there is a repetition of words such as "online", "media" and "internet". When consuming the content, I didn't feel like this was an issue, or something that stood out to me, mostly because these words are use in the correct context and are used appropriately. 
The average word per sentence is also unsurprising to me, 30 words isn't much, and it is very evident when you read the page that you can get your information quickly and without much searching. It's there and it's quick to read.<br></p>
<img id="image" src="Images/voyant_screenshot_2.png">
  

<p>
  Here we can see the use of "positive" and "negative" language. In this websites case, much of the negative language is linked to a direct discussion of a topic, and not the use of negative language to describe or tell their narrative. Their advice, and own words are mostly positive such as "encourage", "Support" and "safe". 
  They seem to be aware of the impact of these negative words and provide alternative, positive language.</p>
</p>
<h2>Task 2: Create Samples of text </h2><br>

  <h3>Sample 1: Introduction to webstite - Would you share this post? </h3> <br>

  <img id="mininformation" src="Images/Misleading info screenshot - week 5.png"> <br>
  
  <p> We can see this is a post about the Covid-19 vaccine, but what do you feel when you read this?<br>
    Fear? Concern?<br>
    This post is delibrately misleading, and the poster is relying on people not to click onto the link to the research paper!<br>
    Keeping in mind the original post, I want you to imaine what the research paper talks about that they have linked. <br>
    Do you think the research paper is <b> Negative?</b>or <b>positive</b> towards the Covid-19 vaccine? 
    Most people would assume the research paper talks about a large amount of negatve effects happening because of the vaccine, right?<br>
    Well, infact, The research paper is a small study done on <b>four</b> patients, and goes on to empasise the importance of getting vaccinated, despite their findings.
    Click the image below to reveal the abstract of the paper. I have highlighted the important parts to note. <br> </p>

    <img id="image3" src="Images/Misleading info - context week 5.png">

  <p>The post about the vaccine is a deliberae attempt at spreading misinformation, as they rely on others to share on social 
    media without reading into the context of the post.<br>
    Unfortunately this is a very common practice on social meddia. People will read the short version, share,
    or pass on this information verbally to friends and family. <br> 
    How many times have you heard somebody say "I read on Twitter..." followed by a statement. <br> 
    Posts like the one above create a talking point, and are easy to digest. <br> 
    <h3>Making it more punchy.</h3>
    <p> After writing these opening statements and viewing them on my website, I immediately felt that it was too much information at once. Not punchy enough. 
      I could still use the graphics, but I feel like I could bring in a better, more punchy opening statement. Such as using media rather than walls of text, like: <br>
